Without seriously considering the pros and cons, I would dare say that I foolishly embarked on this journey without prior preparation and research, resulting in me eventually flunking that semester altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "        âBut you have all the potential in the worldâ â said some of my peers and mentors, who were then envious of me being in this prestigious course. Regardless of whether I was merely being motivated to complete a particular task, or that someone genuinely identified the potential in me, I eventually realized that this quote alone made me hate a lot about myself back then, especially whenever I flunked. I would often feel an overwhelming sense of disappointment whenever I felt that I fell short of my own (high) expectations, which were imposed by this âpotentialâ I thought I had. \n",
    "\n",
    "        In a way, I was humbled by the experience. Thinking that the competition in junior college was tough enough, having the opportunity to meet different varieties of students changed the game for me. Working and interacting with many youths who came from different backgrounds â including student entrepreneurs, future researchers and national athletes, I realized that they were much more driven, passionate and hardworking at their craft than me, and for the right reasons. Unlike me, it was clear that they had long term plans in mind to hone their skills in order to pursue their ideal careers in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "        And so, after taking my second semester off with a leave of absence, I decided to embark on another journey, this time restarting as a data science undergraduate. Knowing that this would delay my graduation and my tuition fees would be higher for my extended final year, I prayed that the journey would be smoother this time round. Although this was definitely not the case due the vastly different disciplines between the 2 degrees, I was privileged to be able to experience a certain degree of success over the next 2 years, even though my academic results signified otherwise. With my expectations being lowered this time round, I felt that at the very least, I was enjoying myself more in whatever I was pursuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Unfortunately, I made the mistake of succumbing to peer pressure once again, this time pursuing too many commitments that I eventually could not handle, resulting in dire consequences both in my academics and interpersonal relationships. Being blinded by greed and ego once more, I knew that I had to take a step back and reflect on what really went wrong, having made the same life mistake multiple times now, which was what I have been doing throughout this semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This was when I truly understood who I really am â one who merely wants to experience life without any comparison to others. I have discovered that the only real critic that I need to value is myself, and develop the self-awareness of whether I am truly enjoying whatever I am doing, or at least fully commit to the purpose of my actions. Not saying that I should downright ignore constructive criticism and opinions against me, but rather question myself from time to time whether their opinions really matter at any particular moment. In addition, self-care is also what I am trying to prioritize, where I should learn to take breaks when necessary.\n",

It was indeed a breath of fresh air that I needed to rebuild myself for the better in the long run. It felt lonely at times, but when you can find happiness and contentment in being alone, whatâs there to stop you from enjoying yourself in better scenarios?\n",

    "        Stamford Raffles. While Raffles had first landed in Singapore in 1819 that helped shape\n",
    "        Singapore to what it is today, Sang Nila Utama had already stepped foot in the country\n",
    "        as early as 1299, founding the nation as the Kingdom of Singapura back then. It is\n",
    "        important to recognise the story behind how the Malay prince first landed on the land\n",
    "        known as Temasek before renaming the land as Singapura. This is especially true\n",
    "        considering that the indigenous people in the country were Malays, and it would be a\n",
    "        better idea to credit more of Singaporeâs history to its geographical neighbours rather than\n",
    "        to British colonialism. The introduction of the Singapore Bicentennial in 2019 also\n",
    "        acknowledges this, citing that not many Singaporeans knew about the existence of Sang\n",

    "        government would want its citizens to better understand Singaporeâs history especially\n",
    "        before 1819, it would be in its best interest to remove the statue instead, to avoid overacknowledging\n",
    "        Rafflesâ influence in Singaporeâs history.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Secondly, the statue should be taken down to avoid misinterpretations that\n",
    "        Singapore is still being influenced by British colonialism. While Singapore is no longer a\n",
    "        British colony, it still establishes a diplomatic relationship with the United Kingdom,\n",
    "        forming various trade and political partnerships between the two countries in the process.\n",

    "        nations are former British colonies. Member nations of this political association enjoy\n",
    "        exclusive diplomatic partnerships with one another to boost each otherâs economies.\n",
    "        However, having the Raffles statue being erected still in Singapore may give an\n",
    "        impression that the country still acknowledges the former British empire as its benefactor.\n",
    "        This is certainly not the case in todayâs context, especially if Singapore wishes to be seen\n",
    "        as an independent nation, it should be recognised as an equal to a country such as the\n",
    "        United Kingdom, and not as an underling of the latter. As such, removing the statue would\n",
    "        help to avoid that misconception.\n",

    "        Thirdly, by removing the statue of Raffles, I believe that this would truly signify\n",

    "        point of time. An example of this would be the membership system in the Singapore\n",

    "        years after the clubâs founding) to participate in its various sporting and social activities,\n",
    "        which were initially only catered to men. In contrast, males were seen to be the more\n",
    "        dominant gender especially due to the prevalence of polygamy, reiterating the stance that\n",
    "        women were indeed inferior to men at that point of time. Later in the colonial era, the\n",

    "\n",
    "        While the introduction of the Womenâs Charter was indeed successful in eventually\n",

    "        rights movement afterwards, as its introduction had already achieved its main purpose\n",
    "        and there was no incentive to further promote gender equality at that point of time. As a\n",
    "        result, an all-male Parliament was eventually formed from 1970 to 1984, with patriarchal\n",
    "        policies being introduced once again. These included the announcement of a quota to\n",
    "        restrict female medical students, as well as the compulsory offering of home economics\n",
    "        as a subject for lower secondary girls. Such acts eventually led to the formation of\n",
    "        AWARE in 1985, which set to undo such discriminatory policies against women and\n",
    "        promote greater gender equality once again. The introduction of AWARE was indeed a\n",

    "        and religious pressures to conform to the roles of wife and mother and to lead a\n",
    "        more secluded lifeâ. This had contrasted with men, whose gender was viewed to be more\n",

    "\n",
    "        Serving as the annual flagship event of NUS SDS, this yearâs Data Analytics Competition attracted over 850 participants across 230 teams from our 6 local universities. Originating as a Data Science Competition a few years ago, our organising team opted for a new format this year, choosing to focus on exploratory data analysis instead to make it more beginner-friendly. This yearâs competition was a great success, which ultimately led to over 100 submissions and 5 top teams over the course of a weekâs efforts. This yearâs competition featured a geospatial dataset graciously sponsored by Grab and participants got to work with real-life transport data across countries in the region. This allowed them to practice their technical skills that they have learnt in class, giving them a glimpse of working as data analysts over a span of four days.\n",

    "\n",
    "        **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "        With the success of last yearâs Data Science Competition hosted by the previous organising team, we wanted to ensure that this yearâs competition was similarly successful to reach a wider audience base. When we initially started planning the competition back in August 2021, we wanted to find a reputable sponsor for the event. Thanks to the Career Advisors at NUS Centre for Future-Ready Graduates (CFG), we were given the chance to pitch to Grab the idea of collaborating for our annual datathon event. Given the impromptu opportunity, we swiftly customised a pitch deck for Grab to explain the benefits of working with us for DAC 2022 such as raising awareness of Grabâs job/internship opportunities for students in NUS. It is not often that we get the opportunity to put our personal presentation skills to good use and convince an external party to host an event that would be beneficial for both parties.\n",

    "        **Learnings**\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. A smooth sea has never made a skilled sailor\n",
    "\n",
    "        Organising such a large-scale datathon isnât easy and will never be. There isnât much information online as to what you need to have and what key points that you will need to take note of. Fortunately, NUS SDS does have previous experience hosting these kinds of events that we could tap into while we were planning for DAC 2022. Previous batchesâ proper documentation of past planning mistakes and general competition guidelines helped us to gain a bigger picture of the event that we wanted to host and visualise the roles that we needed to fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "        When we had first received the dataset from Grab, our organising team was stumped at extracting insights from it as no one on the team had prior experience with geospatial data. Our Workshop Team members, who were supporting the organising team, kindly volunteered to do more research on handling geospatial datasets. Their eagerness and confidence in dealing with the dataset allowed the organising team to confidently move forward with planning the rest of the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "        One major issue that we had faced midway through the planning of the competition was that we had underestimated the amount of work the organising team had to do to get the event up and running. There were indeed many administrative matters to resolve, which included the collation of Non-Disclosure Agreement forms as well as confirming the schedules of our judges to ensure their participation in our event. Handling all these processes in the right manner was indeed crucial to ensure the smooth operations of this event.\n",
    "\n",
    "        On top of this, our initial plan was to host DAC 2022 on the 2nd week of January, when NUS students just started the semester in hopes of getting more teams to sign up. Yet, by the middle of December 2021, the organising team had not much to work with yet, with merely a skeletal structure of the event flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "        After assessing the situation that we were in, where much of the event was not planned yet and the Grab personnel were currently on leave for the holidays, we decided to postpone the event to the start of February, right after the Chinese New Year celebrations to give ourselves more time to plan for the event. The main thought process behind this decision was that a delayed event will always be better than a rushed barely planned event.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Communication is key (by Axel)\n",
    "\n",
    "        It is one thing to have a vision for the competition and another to execute it. For myself, I tend to keep my ideas to myself and prefer to execute simple tasks by myself to not inconvenience others. However, in the scenario that I was in, having to juggle internship and planning of DAC, communicating my ideas to the team for them to execute was becoming increasingly important. After all, hosting DAC is a team effort and not an individual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Delegating tasks to the Events Team allowed for planning to occur even when I was occupied by my internshipâs tasks. Delegating tasks to my team members also had a positive effect, as I was more able to focus on the big picture of the event and realise which areas of planning that we had neglected. Giving freedom to team members to resolve their own tasks at their own prerogative gave them a greater sense of ownership and an incentive to seek out innovative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        One thing that Iâm really proud of in this competition came out of our memberâs initiatives. One of them suggested using Discord as a central hub for disseminating information about the competition and providing a common platform for groups to discuss their projects. Discord has lots of useful bots and functions for running hackathons, such as user-defined roles and room assignment for teams. With Discord, we were also able to allow for Q&A questions to be publicly viewed and referenced by other teams. Using Discord did immensely help to streamline competition communication and I would wholeheartedly recommend other competition organisers to use it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Continuously communicating about what had not been done and what could be improved also helped us to assess the current situation that we were in. This really helped to smooth out the planning process and ensure that we covered any blind spots that we had failed to consider at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Fortunately, our efforts paid off in the end, as there was an increase in the number of signups overall. This was particularly impressive, considering that we hosted our competition at a much later period compared to last year and were in fact expecting a decrease in participation rates. In fact, one of our main considerations of planning this event was to reinvigorate student life given the current COVID-19 situation. We were indeed glad to see that the large number of signups was a testament of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Of course, this would not have been possible without the help of our Publicity Team members, who reached out to nearly 40 other student clubs to help us increase our outreach for the event. Other NUS departments such as CFG, Faculty of Science and School of Computing also helped us to publicise our event, which was much appreciated. Indeed, weâve learnt that itâs vital for us to maintain good relations with other like-minded student organisations to ensure the success of organising such events.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Failure is the key to success (by Harry)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Similar to Axel, I gave my Marketing Team members the liberty to identify potential sponsors that could support our event. Doing this would allow them to learn more about the data/tech industry in general before we would proceed to shortlist our prospective partners and/or sponsors. Our team had managed to identify many different companies from various industries, but had faced rejections in the process. Worst still, many companies did not respond to our sponsorship emails, which felt demoralising at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "        With multiple waves of attempts however, we managed to secure enough sponsors to support our event. Furthermore, we even exceeded our own sponsorship target in the end, leading to an overall increase in the prize pool compared to last yearâs competition. The addition of having sponsored t-shirts from an external company was also a nice touch, given that this would entice participants to send in a valid submission to us for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In summary, pursuing sponsorships was indeed an eye-opening experience for our team. This has taught us to be resilient when facing hardships or dejections, which would only make us mentally stronger over time. Without experiencing prior failures, achieving small successes like these would not be as enjoyable as one would expect. \n",

The success of this event would not have been possible without the help and guidance from our fellow members in NUSSDS who excelled at their different roles:\n",

    "\n",
    "        - Our Marketing Team members: Gordon and Chenxiao for securing sponsors for DAC 2022; as well as Hannah and Aengus, for helping to manage a âTeam Finderâ feature of the event. This Team Finder matches people to form a team and was a rather important feature that we wanted to have. As most lessons are still taught virtually, we wanted to use DAC 2022 as a chance to connect data enthusiasts together to work on a meaningful project and from this experience hopefully build new friendships. Keeping to the theme of making the competition beginner-friendly, we wanted to make it as inclusive as possible to individuals who might not know many people interested in the field of data analytics. Hence, the Team Finder was important as it helps participants to make new friends and network with fellow data enthusiasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Stephen and Rui En, along with their Workshops Team members Keith, Javier and Wei Liang, for helping us to better understand the dataset and were integral in helping us to word the problem statement for the competition. Having them around to work on understanding the dataset really helped to lighten the load on the Events Team. During the actual competition, they assisted to get participants started on the provided dataset by hosting an introductory workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Ethan and his Publicity Team members Briana, Tze Lynn and Yi Xuan, for helping to design cool slides and social media posts to make DAC 2022 look appealing!

    "        COVID-19 has worsened health disparities within countries based on ethnicity, as the latter often corresponded to socioeconomic status (SES) levels. In general, lower-income minorities are more prone to chronic illnesses and would require more care. This is especially true for illegal immigrants who tend to avoid local healthcare facilities altogether to prevent future deportation. For instance, in the US, African-American and Hispanic minorities are more probable in living in congested environments and working in blue-collar jobs compared to the Caucasian majority. These minorities tend to travel by bus or train with large crowds, as many of them do not own private vehicles. By considering such conditions, these individuals would be more likely to fall ill and even contract airborne illnesses, including COVID-19 (Lopez, 2021). Furthermore, recent COVID-19 data has shown that mortality and hospitalisation rates have an association with Black or Brown ethnicities, also commonly described as the âethnicity effectâ. US hospitalisation rates were much higher amongst the African-Americans (1.8) and Hispanics (1.6) compared to the Whites (0.5) when considering these ethnicitiesâ prevalence ratios (Hughes et al., 2021). It was also reported in July 2020 that 1.6 million Hispanics in the US were deprived of their healthcare coverage due to COVID-19 (Gangopadhyaya et al., 2020). As the aforementioned argument demonstrated that ethnicity is often stereotyped as an SES indicator, it is proven that ethnic minorities within countries generally have poorer health outcomes. Therefore, COVID-19 has indeed widened the health disparities in terms of ethnicity within countries, particularly when comparing the Whites and the Blacks/Browns.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        COVID-19 has also widened health disparities within countries based on gender. Traditionally, women would tend to be at a physical disadvantage compared to males, often leading to a greater risk of undergoing various health problems for the former. Based on biological research, women have a higher chance of experiencing musculoskeletal diseases including osteoporosis, and subsequently cardiovascular health problems as compared to men. This gender health disparity is further exacerbated especially with the introduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions due to COVID-19, limiting the healthcare required for treatment, especially amongst females (Guerrina, 2021). Besides physical well-being, the mental health aspect has also been adversely affected especially amongst women as compared to men. In a 2020 Jordan study, research has revealed that almost 40% of locals have experienced anxiety from COVID-19 related quarantines. Amongst these individuals, data has showed âthat psychological stress levels were significantly higher in women, especially in unmarried or younger than 50âyearsâ (Massad et al, 2020). In the UK, it was also discovered that domestic violence rates have more than doubled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The typical pre-pandemic death rate of about 6 deaths (of women and children) per month due to such violence peaked at 16 during the first month of lockdown in the country (Bambra et al., 2021). Again, this increased domestic violence is often attributed to social isolations which have aggregated the mental well-being of families during the pandemic. In summary, case studies have shown that women are likely to experience more long-term physical and mental health problems than men, and this gender health disparity has evidently increased due to COVID-19.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        To conclude, the worsening gender health disparity due to COVID-19 is more serious as compared to that of ethnicity. Women, often appointed the role of caregivers to children, are essential in growing our global population of future generations. However, given the fact that approximately 70% of healthcare workers are female worldwide (Salles, 2021), the latter is at a much higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, which would be detrimental to human reproduction in order to maintain or grow the global population due to the lives of females lost to the pandemic. On the other hand, the worsening ethnic health disparity due to COVID-19 would be considered relatively less serious as many governments worldwide are experiencing related issue(s) that are either similar or exactly the same. They can collaborate with each other in an international forum and come up with a general solution, before tweaking them based on their respective contexts to help close this ethnic gap in their individual countries.\n",

    "        An obstacle that may undermine national efforts aimed at reducing childhood obesity in high-income countries would be the lack of support by parents to cultivate healthy eating habits amongst children. As children are deemed rationally unprepared to make their own decisions at a young age, the actions of their parents are imperative in influencing their childrenâs behaviours. This is especially the case when children view their parents as their role models who they would like to develop similar traits with when they grow up in the future. In a 2019 Singaporean study, parents conveyed various difficulties in trying to promote healthy eating habits to their children. Parents preoccupied with work and other commitments do not have adequate time to prepare healthy food for their children. They would often opt to eat outside or order takeaways instead of consuming home-cooked meals, which increases the likelihood of fast food consumption instead. Furthermore, they cited the dietary preferences for less healthy food by either their spouse or their own parents that would compromise their own efforts in promoting healthy eating to their children (Chong, 2021). These observations are also similar in other high-income countries in the European Union (EU), including Germany and Italy. In a 2018 online survey targeted at 187 policy-makers and stakeholders from 12 EU member states, 67.6% of the respondents agreed that the lack of parental support contributed to the prevention of childhood obesity, ranking it amongst the top three reasons from a possible nine listed in the survey (Abu-Omar et al., 2018).\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Another obstacle that may hinder national efforts to reduce childhood obesity in high-income countries would be the difficulty in enforcing regulations against unhealthy food marketing. As most food companies aim to generate profits by maximising revenue and minimising costs, they may not necessarily be obliged to promote healthier foods, especially when the latter may not be as popular amongst citizens compared to fast foods and sugary beverages. In fact, eating healthily is considered a more costly option due to the higher cost required to farm fresh fruits and vegetables, even in high-income countries such as the USA (Sotirovska & Philip, 2018). Moreover, promoting healthier foods is considered high-risk, especially when competing firms choose to continue marketing their less healthy yet popular products instead. To illustrate, PepsiGo had unsuccessfully attempted to market healthier products in the past, resulting in a fall in revenue and market share. It had to recenter its focus to its main products (e.g Cheetos, Doritos and Pepsi) to gradually regain its position in the food industry (Fleming-Milici & Harris, 2020). Even with increasing regulations against unhealthy food marketing in different countries, the wide usage of social media platforms especially amongst todayâs children is a loophole constantly exploited by food companies to maximise their outreach and promote the sale of their products. As such, the difficulty in regulating unhealthy food marketing deters national efforts to reduce childhood obesity, particularly due to firmsâ common aim to maximise profits by any means necessary, even at the possible expense of their consumersâ long-term health.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        In my personal opinion, the lack of parental support to promote healthy eating habits is a more difficult obstacle to overcome compared to the difficulty in regulating unhealthy food marketing when it comes to reducing childhood obesity in high-income countries. Given the fast pace of living in metropolitan areas, it is understandable that citizens living in such conditions may not necessarily afford the luxury of time to prepare healthy meals diligently for their children, especially when they are working. In addition, parents would struggle to constantly find the motivation to impose a healthy diet on their children or themselves all the time. A sudden slip-up in maintaining such efforts may lead to a rebound towards unhealthy food consumption once again, which is especially detrimental for parents as their children would likely be influenced to follow suit. On the other hand, tackling unhealthy food marketing may be an easier problem to overcome. As online media is often referred to as a double-edged sword, it can either be used by firms to positively promote healthy eating habits or encourage unhealthy food consumption instead. Therefore, it would ultimately be up to the individualâs self-control to decide which form of influence to follow when it comes to making eating decisions.\n",

    "        Contact tracing was one method which demonstrated the usage of healthcare data analytics to help tackle the pandemic. The idea behind contact tracing revolves around the usage of mobile applications for users to transmit their localisation data as unchangeable time-stamped records into a common database. This database will then be used as an investigation system by governments to trace persons who either had contact with newly infected patients or had frequented high-risk areas. Collecting such data also ensures that users suspected of contracting COVID-19 are not contravening self-isolation protocols, as their locations are constantly monitored to deter them from doing so (Benreguia et al., 2020). Moreover, Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea have resorted to tracking their citizensâ movements without the latterâs consent to maximise the effectiveness of contact tracing efforts (Nageshwaran et al., 2021). In particular, the TraceTogether mobile application, developed in Singapore, has greatly assisted the country in identifying suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Using this application involves the exchange of Bluetooth signals between phones within range of each other to discover nearby users. With the increasing number of confirmed cases in Singapore, the usage of TraceTogether application was eventually made compulsory for users to check-in when visiting high traffic areas such as shopping centres and workplaces using the in-built SafeEntry system within the application for them to monitor their whereabouts. The local authorities commended TraceTogether for helping to âreduce the average time taken to contact trace from four days to less than 1.5 daysâ (Low, 2021), indicating its usefulness in Singaporeâs battle against COVID-19.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Data analytics also contributed to healthcare decision-making by helping countries to âevaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures'' (Alsunaidi et al., 2021). To illustrate, a study on China published in March 2020 concluded that restricting and relaxing quarantine measures at different timings greatly impacts the trend in the number of daily cases in the subsequent stages of the outbreak (Chen et al., 2020). Using the data of daily confirmed cases reported in Hubei, the researchers ran a simulation using the C-SEIR mathematical model (Zhang et al., 2005) to predict different peak periods of the pandemic in the region. The simulation revealed that adjusting the lockdown start date earlier or later by two days could have decreased or increased the number of confirmed cases by almost twice the actual amount respectively. Furthermore, the study showed that the relaxation of such restrictive measures should occur in a more controlled manner to minimise the number of infections and avoid experiencing subsequent large waves of infections. In correspondence to the studyâs results, China has adopted a âzero tolerance policyâ as its main public health approach, as its main priority remains in preserving the good health of its citizens and minimising deaths (Ning et al., 2020). Strict lockdowns are enforced whenever clusters occur in certain regions, which includes the restriction of inter-city movements such as workplace closures and transport bans. The daily cases in China remain negligible compared to other countries such as Britain and USA, both which have adopted the endemic approach of living with the virus instead (Feng, 2021). While Chinaâs approach is effective in minimising daily infections, this may come at a high economic cost, especially when the country relies on the international market to boost its economy, which is hindered by travel restrictions. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        While both above-mentioned applications of healthcare data analytics have their respective merits, contact tracing is a more successful contribution in comparison to the control of the COVID-19 restrictive measures. With reference to the Socio-Ecological Model, the main focus of contract tracing is at the individual level. Individuals would be more conscious to only leave their houses whenever necessary, or at the very least monitor their whereabouts to minimise the risk of infection during the pandemic. On the other hand, the control of restrictive measures focuses at the policy level, since the decision making by governments on such measures affects its citizensâ livelihoods, which may not be agreeable by all members of the local community especially when the countryâs economy would be affected in the long run. As such, contact tracing would be deemed more successful in its contribution against COVID-19, especially when the individual belief of exercising social responsibility has the potential to relieve the burden borne by governments to tackle the virus. After all, the prevention of more cases is indeed better than cure.\n",

    "        In 1979, the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) was established in order to preserve the heritage of top Chinese schools, nurture traditional Chinese values in students and promote bilingualism. Today, critics question the relevance of SAP schools, as they claim that these schools no longer fulfil their original goals. Instead, they cite these schools as an example of âChinese privilegeâ in Singapore, which is defined as a scenario where âChinese-Singaporeans, unlike minority Malays, Indians, or Eurasians, enjoy exclusive racial advantages that position them as Singaporeâs cultural, economic, political, and social coreâ. In my opinion, SAP has reinforced âChinese privilegeâ in Singapore as it has been perceived by Singaporeans to promote racial segregation and social inequality instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "        For starters, the admission criteria required to enrol in these schools heavily favour the top Chinese students, which may encourage âChinese elitismâ, where they deem themselves to be superior compared to their non-Chinese peers due to their enrolment in SAP schools. SAP students are not only required to take Chinese as a subject in the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE), but also at the secondary level. Furthermore, SAP schools are only open to the top 30% of students in each PSLE cohort. In fact, some SAP schools are more stringent with their admission requirements, including Hwa Chong Institution, which admits only the top 3% of PSLE graduates annually. While this is partly due to historical prestige, government policies were also introduced to boost the elite status of the SAP schools. When educational streaming was first introduced in Singapore, only the nine SAP schools at the time were banded as âSpecialâ, which formally branded them as the cream of the crop amongst all Singapore schools. Subsequently, the Integrated Programme (IP) was later introduced, allowing top secondary school students to skip the GCE âOâ Level examination and proceed to take a national pre-university examination after six years of secondary education. As SAP schools were among the first to pilot the programme, about 35% of the IP schools also benefit from SAP today. Enrolling in such prestigious institutions would indeed be a âChinese privilegeâ, particularly due to the compulsory prerequisite of studying Mandarin, which would disadvantage the students from minority races who are mostly unable to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "        In addition, the lack of daily interaction with people of other races may discourage multiracialism amongst SAP students, which arises from the inadequate ethnic sensitivities of other racial groups. While SAP schools are open to all eligible students regardless of race, they are required to be highly proficient in Mandarin as it is the only mother tongue offered. This, along with the strong Chinese tradition of SAP schools, have greatly discouraged students of minority races from enrolling. As such, the minimal inter-ethnic interaction experienced by SAP students results in them having âless ethnically diverse social networks than their non-SAP peers.â To support this, a 2012 Straits Times survey conducted amongst the top 5 schools (of which 2 are in SAP) revealed that 82% of SAP students reported a lack of close friends from other races, compared to 12% for the non-SAP schools. In a RICE Media interview, a Malay SAP alumnus elaborated that certain SAP students lack cultural knowledge of other races, citing quotes such as âI canât differentiate between Malay and Indianâ and being asked âif water was halalâ. This shows that minorities who enrol in SAP schools would find it nearly impossible to avoid racist jokes and insensitive comments from their Chinese peers in SAP schools, suggesting the latterâs inability to interact meaningfully with other races. In fact, students from minority races would find it challenging to represent their own races and cultures to face the predominantly Chinese cohort of SAP students. This would ultimately lead to an increased racial segregation between the Chinese and the minority races, as xenophobic sentiments may arise especially from the former, believing that their status as the majority race is indeed a social privilege in Singapore. Despite the governmentâs attempts to alleviate this through Racial Harmony Day celebrations and weekly conversational Malay lessons, this may be insufficient to encourage inter-racial understanding between students of different races. A possible suggestion to rectify this would be to abolish the SAP system. By eliminating the prerequisite of studying Mandarin in these Chinese schools, this would allow the minority races to be better represented in each school. Also, this provides more opportunities for daily interactions between the different races to better promote multiracialism in all schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Furthermore, students in SAP schools are provided an âunequal access to educational resourcesâ compared to their peers in other public schools, which reinforces the idea of âChinese privilegeâ in Singapore. As a reward for performing well under Singaporeâs meritocratic system, students in SAP schools experience multiple advantages over their counterparts in other schools. For instance, SAP schools enjoyed additional funding in the form of annual grants and interest-free loans, including a per capita government funding for SAP school students that was up to over 50% higher than other secondary school students during the programmeâs initial years. In 2019, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung updated that each SAP student receives an additional S\\$300 âto develop their proficiency and interest in Chinese language-related studies.â SAP schools often receive donations from alumni working in top organisations and firms to repay their alma mater for contributing to their educational success. These schools also have a lower student-teacher ratio, as attributed in their additional funding used to improve both the quality and quantity of their teaching staff. In particular, selected SAP schools offer the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP), which provides its top students with unrivalled opportunities to visit China and learn more about Chinese culture and values through daily interactions with the mainland Chinese. As BSP is not offered to non-SAP schools, this signifies the increased government funding that is invested in nurturing the SAP elites. Again, these privileges are only offered to students that take Chinese as an examinable subject, which mostly excludes the minority races. As such, the advantages that are offered to SAP schools reinforces the idea that âChinese privilegeâ exists, given that the SAP students are mostly Chinese. To alleviate this, a âdonation capâ can be imposed by the government on SAP schools to prevent them from receiving excessive financial support for additional facilities and exclusive programmes. Under this framework, donations should be declared and checked annually by the government. SAP schools which exceed this âdonation capâ would then incur a decrease in additional funding per student, down from S\\$300 to S\\$150 for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Moreover, SAP âperpetuates social inequality by instilling cultural capital in its students that enables them to thrive in a world where China is an emerging economy of opportunitiesâ. To justify the relevance of SAP, Ong Ye Kung explained in 2019 that the rapid development of China, as Singaporeâs largest trading partner, raises the importance of helping students to amass Chinese cultural capital. Doing so could reap economic benefits when doing business with China, especially when one possesses Chinese cultural knowledge that is essential in facilitating access and building strong professional ties with Chinaâs market, which serves as a key motivation behind SAP. As mentioned earlier, the introduction of BSP to selected SAP schools exemplifies this belief, as top students are offered the opportunity to visit China and learn the Chinese culture, language and values directly from daily interactions with the mainland Chinese. Pierre Bourdieuâs concept of capital suggests that by having a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and values, SAP students could be well-versed with the âknowledge, skills and abilities to pursue further opportunities professionally and maintain or advance their social positions,â provided that they seize the opportunities to make these connections. These include either working or studying in China, as well as building professional ties with Chinese firms and individuals. By restricting such opportunities to a handful of students from a particular racial group, this widens the inequality gap between the SAP and non-SAP students since the latter do not have access to such overseas immersion programmes. To resolve this, the government can consider expanding BSP to Malay and Tamil-speaking students, especially in the form of overseas immersion programmes for non-SAP public schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Given that Singapore boasts a population that is nearly 75% Chinese, the SAP is a prime example of how âChinese privilegeâ is deemed prevalent in the country today. The government should explore solutions to minimise the unfair advantages enjoyed by the SAP schools. As previously mentioned, it can reduce the additional funding to resolve the unfair allocation of resources that favours the SAP schools. Alternatively, SAP can be expanded by creating similar programmes that cater to Malay and Tamil-speaking students and offered to all schools in Singapore to close the inequality gap between the Chinese and the minority races. Better still, SAP should be abolished to ensure a more equal representation of all races in every school and encourage multiracialism amongst students through inter-racial interactions. These suggestions would align with the Ministry of Educationâs vision that âevery school is a good schoolâ.\n",

    "        language of its users.\n",
    "\n",
    "        In 2019, a study was implemented to explore how to differentiate high-stress users from\n",

    "        posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "        To facilitate data collection, the studyâs researchers deployed a survey on Qualtrics, which\n",
    "        consisted of several demographic questions (age, gender, race, education, income) and the\n",
    "        Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire. Each item in the scale is scored from 0 to 4, with an\n",
    "        absolute maximum summing to 40. The stress scores for each survey participant range from\n",
    "        6 to 39, with a mean value of 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Interestingly, the researchers chose to obtain their data from Facebook and Twitter, as they\n",
    "        are amongst the most widely used social media platforms worldwide. Survey participants\n",
    "        were invited to share access to their Facebook and/or Twitter posts. Among the\n",
    "        participants, 601 users completed the survey and had active accounts with more than 900\n",
    "        words on Facebook and Twitter. Their social media posts were then downloaded by using\n",

    "        based in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The posts were then processed using the HappierFunTokenizer available with the DLATK\n",
    "        package in Python. The language of each user and county is then represented as a set of\n",
    "        features. In the dictionary-based method, social media language is transformed into\n",
    "        numerical features representing percentage proportions of lexical categories in an existing\n",

    "        their frequency distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Afterwards, 1-,2-, and 3-grams were extracted from all posts to analyse significant\n",

    "        visualizations of the Pearson correlations of words and phrases with stress scores obtained\n",
    "        from the survey. The word clouds were generated by uploading the dataset containing the\n",

    "        exists today. The red word cloud represents words commonly used by users with high stress\n",

    "        The size of each word indicates the correlation strength while the colour intensity indicates\n",
    "        frequency (darker being more frequent).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Based on the researchersâ analysis, the language of high stress users is made prevalent\n",
    "        either by expressions of perceived lack of control, expressions of a need state or a lack of\n",

    "        Most of the time, the size of each word in a word cloud corresponds to the relative\n",

    "\n",
    "        Although word clouds are simple to visualize and interpret, there are certain limitations that\n",

    "        âdepressedâ and âdepressionâ, as well as âIâ and âmeâ, are almost equal in size when\n",
    "        compared in their own pairs. Having such synonyms as duplicated could omit out other\n",
    "        unique words from appearing in the word cloud, which could affect the researchersâ analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "        Another limitation of the visualisations discussed is that only Facebook data was used,\n",
    "        despite also gaining access to the usersâ Twitter updates during the data collection phase.\n",
    "        To improve the results of the analysis, separate sets of word clouds can be generated using\n",
    "        posts from other popular social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and\n",

This is a perfect example of a taste interaction between different taste qualities. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        When two or more taste qualities interact, they affect the perception of one another. The taste qualities involved can either enhance or suppress one another, which is dependent on their concentrations.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Previous studies have shown that cultural differences do affect taste sensitivities and taste interactions amongst different individuals. For instance, a US study discovered that taste sensitivities across all five taste qualities are lower amongst individuals of African-American and Hispanic origin compared to Caucasians. Another study also revealed that Taiwanese students tend to have higher sweetness sensitivity compared to their American counterparts.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Thus, a new study has sought to validate the above-mentioned findings. Conducted by a group of Danish and Chinese researchers earlier this year, this cross-cultural study suggested that culture does affect taste interactions to a certain degree. In particular, Danish consumers experienced a smaller extent of sourness suppression by the sweetness of sucrose as compared to their Chinese counterparts.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        To the researchersâ surprise, they discovered that the vice versa does not prove to be true. As they could not establish a relationship between culture and the extent of sourness suppressing sweetness, this suggests that the differences in taste perception may need to be further classified at the individual level. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        So, in the first place, how does the suppression between sweetness and sourness occur?\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Sucrose, widely known as table sugar, undergoes hydrolysis to be further decomposed to glucose and fructose. This process can be quickened by introducing acids such as citric acid, commonly present in fruit juices. As such, hydrolysis reduces the formation of sugar crystals, explaining how sourness can suppress sweetness.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Let us now try to break down this process from another perspective. Citric acid, for instance, has an estimated pH of 2.2, which exemplifies its relatively high acidity to its sourness. On the other hand, sucrose is known to be slightly alkaline â and a bit bitter, given its higher pH value of 8. However, when citric acid is introduced to sucrose, the resultant solution will have a pH range between 4 to 7. Simply put, we can also make use of the same reaction to explain how sweetness suppresses sourness.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        To further appreciate the findings of the study, we should also understand how taste sensitivities relate to taste preferences. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        In a separate study conducted by Canadian researchers in 2019, there is evidence of a relationship between certain taste sensitivities of consumers and their taste preferences. In particular, sweetness and saltiness were revealed to be less preferred by consumers who recorded higher sensitivities in these two taste qualities.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        As such, the study sought to investigate how these taste interactions vary between both cultures. The Danish and Chinese test subjects evaluated six liquid mixtures: namely water, sucrose, tartaric acid, citric acid, a mixture of sucrose with tartaric acid and sucrose mixed with citric acid. Both citric and tartaric acids were used as samples to exhibit the taste of sourness, while sucrose was used to exhibit sweetness.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Participants were tasked to taste one sample at a time, with a 30 second break in between after rinsing their mouth with water. For each sample, the taste sensitivity was evaluated on a 9-point scale, with 1 being ânot at allâ and 9 rated as âextremelyâ sweet or sour, depending on the sample.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        For samples containing a mixture of sweetness and sourness, they were evaluated with an additional âJust About Rightâ (JAR) scale to measure the appropriate concentrations of sucrose and acids based on each individual. Together with the taste sensitivities, the JAR ratings for each sample were recorded using a questionnaire. Data collected from this questionnaire was later used for further analysis.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        On average, the Danish consumers consistently recorded higher sweetness sensitivities than their Chinese counterparts. This further explains how the researchers concluded that sucrose had managed to suppress tartaric acid to a greater extent in Chinese consumers compared to the Danish consumers.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The researchers added that based on their research on similar studies, a Caucasian population generally tends to have a lower taste sensitivity for sweetness, sourness, saltiness and bitterness than an Asian population. Since an inverse relationship between taste sensitivity and taste preference has been established from the Canadian study, comparing the taste sensitivities of these Chinese and Danish consumers may therefore not be entirely representative of the âEast vs. Westâ comparison.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        In addition, the researchers could not conclude if culture had a role in sweetness suppression by sourness. This is because the results had varied between each individual, regardless of whether they were Chinese or Danish.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Upon obtaining the necessary readings, the test subjects were later divided into three different clusters based on their relative sensitivities to sourness.

    "        \n",
    "        This same method of classification based on sweetness was also performed on these customers. Likewise, each cluster comprised of both Chinese and Danish consumers.

    "        According to an update from the World Health Organisation (WHO), nearly 10 million cases of measles were reported in the year 2018. During that year, more than 140,000 people worldwide have died from the disease. In addition, reported measles cases have surged internationally in devastating outbreaks across different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Besides the mild symptoms of fever, runny nose and body rashes, this highly contagious disease may also lead to long term effects on the immune systems of those affected. For instance, as many as 1 in 20 children with measles will contract pneumonia, which is the leading cause of death amongst young children. In addition, about 1 in every 1000 who contract measles will develop encephalitis - or brain infection - which can result in the child being deaf or developing intellectual disability. This raises the importance of vaccinating children so that they will not have to live with such complications in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Despite the long existence of an effective and cost-efficient vaccine, the outbreak of measles remains a pressing global health issue particularly for developing countries. These nations have often been identified to lack access to vaccinations and high-quality health infrastructure.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        As such, a study on the measles outbreak in Pakistan has predicted that optimising the timing of a vaccination campaign plays an important role in reducing the total infections of measles.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The study, led by senior researcher Niket Thakkar from the Institute for Disease Modelling (based in the USA), was conducted in response to the sudden increase in measles cases within the span of a year. From 2016 to 2017, the number of cases in Pakistan have more than doubled, as confirmed by local laboratories.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Prior to the study, measles vaccination coverage in toddlers aged under 2 was estimated to be 61% nationwide, as cited from Pakistanâs Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 2012 â 2013. With Pakistan being identified as one of the top countries with the most unvaccinated infants, the need to improve this rate was therefore essential, as suggested by Thakkar and his team of researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The researchers came up with a mathematical model which uses linear regression to predict the severity of future outbreaks. Using case data from Pakistan that contains the number of new measles cases per month, they predicted the number of cases of subsequent months within the next three years. This data was also categorised by province level to compare the severity of the measles outbreak between different regions in Pakistan. \n",
    "\n",
    "        To understand how linear regression works, let us think of this example. If you spent \\$10 on a Monday, \\$20 on a Tuesday, \\$30 on a Wednesday, how much would you win on Thursday? If your answer is $40, youâve just performed linear regression - this method thus makes use of available information to constantly make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This model assisted researchers in understanding when and where the vaccine should be distributed within the country. Their results show that holding a vaccination campaign in November has the greatest impact, with an estimated 440,000 more infections that could be prevented in comparison to a January campaign. These results were later used by the Pakistani government in vaccination planning, which led to the implementation of the campaign in November 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "        According to the study, less cases were confirmed from May to October as compared to the rest of the year. This suggests a low transmission season during this period, reiterating why the campaign is best implemented in November, when cases start to surge again. As a result of this implementation, the estimated measles vaccination coverage in infants aged under 2 had improved to 73% nationwide. This statistic was reported in 2017 â 2018âs iteration of Pakistanâs DHS, which was published in January 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "        On the other hand, if the campaign was delayed from November 2018 to May 2019, can you guess the number of additional infections that would have occurred? There would have been more than 600,000 additional infections from 2018 to 2021 - this significant number is sandwiched between the population sizes of Sialkot and Sukkur, the 13th and 14th most densely populated cities in Pakistan respectively (out of 99 cities in total). As such, this further justifies the researchersâ preference for the campaign to be conducted in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Beyond immediate outbreak response, countries should continue investing in high quality immunisation programmes, as well as disease surveillance. This would help to ensure that these outbreaks are detected quickly and stopped as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It is indeed a tragedy to witness a sudden increase in cases and deaths from a disease that is easily preventable, especially in recent times. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that even the poorest countries have access to these high-quality vaccination programmes. This would help prevent the unnecessary loss of lives to easily treatable diseases, including measles.\n",
